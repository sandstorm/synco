# Setup for `pterm/cli-template`

This setup script is automatically ran by the PTerm-CI system the first time you use this template.\
Here is a list, of what it will do:

1. Detect your GitHub path
1. Replace all import paths from `pterm/cli-template` to your GitHub path
1. Replace the README.md with an automated template

After running this script, the whole directory (`./setup`) will be deleted.
